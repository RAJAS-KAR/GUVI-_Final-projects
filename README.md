# Problem Statement :
You are working for a new-age insurance company and employ
mutiple outreach plans to sell term insurance to your
customers. Telephonic marketing campaigns still remain one of
the most effective way to reach out to people however they
incur a lot of cost. Hence, it is important to identify the
customers that are most likely to convert beforehand so that
they can be specifically targeted via call. We are given the
historical marketing data of the insurance company and are
required to build a ML model that will predict if a client will
subscribe to the insurance
# solution : 
customer Conversion Prediction to predict the customer will subcribe to insurance or not using historical data.done some EDA(exploratory data anlysis) and find that this dataset imbalaced data so using SMOTEN function balanced the data and applied all machine learning model and find the best model to predict 

# STEPS NEED TO BE FOLLOWED :
1.Import the required package

2.Import the dataset

3.Checking if the data is balanced or not and findout tha data is imbalanced 

4. Done some EDA(exploratort data anlysis) to understand the distribution of the data

5. Encoding the catagorical featrue
 
6. Using SMOTEENN to Balanced the data
 
7. Fitting all classification model to predict the converstion

8. Use evaluation metric score to findout the best model
